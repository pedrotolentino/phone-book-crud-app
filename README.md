Simple phone book application with CRUD operations

Your task is to create a simple phone book application with CRUD operations. You can use any front-end framework you want (e.g. React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.). For the back end, you can use Java with any framework of your choice as well along with the database (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).


Your application should provide a form where you can enter in first name, last name, and phone number. You should then be able to perform 4 basic operations: create new entries in your database, read the entries, update entries by editing any of the properties, and delete the entries.


For the read operations, you must consider the capability to receive query params to properly filter the registries directly on the database, instead of filtering the front end.


You should build proper unit and integration tests for your API with meaningful tests.


For your API documentation, create an OpenAPI Specification and store it with examples at the root of your project. Please mind using proper return codes and meaningful information.
